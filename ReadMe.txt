1. **Importing Libraries**:
   - `numpy`: Utilized for numerical computations and matrix operations.
   - `cv2`: The OpenCV library, employed for image processing.
   - `ObjectDetection`: A specialized module for object detection.
   - `math`: Used for mathematical computations, particularly distance calculations.

2. **Euclidean Distance Calculation Function**:
   - `sq_euclidean_distance`: Computes the squared Euclidean distance between two points.

3. **Initializing Object Detector**:
   - An instance of the `ObjectDetection` class is created.
   - Variables for frame counter (`count`), previous frame points (`prev_points`), car tracking dictionary (`car_tracking`), and car ID (`car_id`) are defined.

4. **Opening Video Source**:
   - The video file `highway.mp4` is opened using `cv2.VideoCapture`.

5. **Reading and Processing Video Frames**:
   - Each frame is read and resized.
   - The loop is exited if the frame is not available.
   - The `current_points` list is utilized to store the central points of objects in the current frame.

6. **Object Detection**:
   - The `oD.detect` method is employed to detect objects in the frame, returning class labels, scores, and bounding boxes.
   - For each detected object, central points are calculated and appended to the `current_points` list.
   - Detected objects are highlighted with rectangles drawn on the frame.

7. **Vehicle Tracking**:
   - For the initial two frames, distances between previous and current points are computed. Distances less than 30 pixels result in a new vehicle ID being assigned and added to the `car_tracking` dictionary.
   - In subsequent frames, the positions of existing vehicles are updated or new vehicles are added.
   - Distances between points in previous and current frames are calculated to update the positions of matched objects.
   - For unmatched objects, a new vehicle ID is assigned and added to the `car_tracking` dictionary.

8. **Displaying Vehicles on Frame**:
   - For each vehicle in the `car_tracking` dictionary, a circle is drawn at the vehicle's center, and the vehicle ID is displayed as text.

9. **Displaying Information and Frame**:
   - Vehicle tracking information and the remaining points in the current frame are printed.
   - The frame is displayed.
   - The loop is terminated and video processing ends upon a key press.

10. **Releasing Resources**:
    - The video source is released, and all OpenCV windows are closed.
